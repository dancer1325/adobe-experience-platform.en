# Tags overview

* Adobe Experience Platform's Tags
  * == Adobe's NEXT generation of tag management capabilities
  * uses
    * customers -- can easily -- deploy & manage
      * analytics,
        * _Example:_ if you deploy Adobe Analytics -> tags -- will --
          * manage the AppMeasurement JavaScript library,
          * populate variables,
          * fire requests
      * marketing,
      * advertising tags
  * enable build & maintain their OWN extensions (== integrations) / available | [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] customers

## Key benefits {#key-benefits}

* Faster time to value
* data centralized collection / organized
* integration of data + marketing technology

## Key features {#key-features}

* right panel -- to learn MORE about -- tags
  ![Tags properties in the Data Collection UI.](./images/ui/tags-overview/tags-properties.png)

### Extensions {#extensions}

* extension
  * == package of code (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) / 
    * extends the tags functionality
    * use a virtually self-service interface

### Extension catalog {#extension-catalog}

* == third-party solutions -- via -- tags

### Rule builder {#rule-builder}

* -- provide options for
  * Events
  * Conditions
  * Exceptions
  * Actions
* includes
  * real-time error checking
  * syntax highlighting

### Data elements {#data-elements}

* -- across -- 
  * web-based marketing technology
  * advertising technology

### Enterprise publishing {#enterprise-publishing}

* TODO:
The publishing process enables teams to publish code to pages. 
Different people can create an implementation, approve it, and publish it on your pages.

* Changes to your code are encapsulated within the libraries you define.
* You specify where and when you want your code deployed.
* Multiple libraries can be built in parallel by different teams.
* Unlimited development environments.
* A deliberate, permission-based process for merging libraries together.

### Open APIs {#open-apis}

* uses
  * automate implementations of 
    * individual technologies or
    * group of technologies

* use cases
  * Tags -- interact with the -- Reactor API
  * Deployments -- can be automated through -- APIs
  * Integrate the APIs -- with your -- OWN internal systems
  * build your OWN UI 

### Light, modular container tag {#modular-tag}

* your container's content (INCLUDING your CUSTOM code) -- is -- [minified](./ui/publishing/builds.md)
  * Reason: üß†EVERYTHING is modular üß†
  * ‚ùåif an item is NOT needed -> NOT included | your library ‚ùå
  * == implementation is fast & compact

## Other highlights {#other-highlights}

* ‚ùåNO use `document.write ()` | Chrome does NOT allow it ‚ùå
* Page Top & Page Bottom rules
  * -- are bundled into the -- MAIN library
  * if you avoid them -> the code -- is -- MOSTLY asynchronous / 
    * EXIST path -- to get -- FULLY async
* CUSTOM rule's action scripts 
  * -- can be loaded in -- parallel
  * are executed sequentially
* ‚ùåNO additional charge ‚ùå
